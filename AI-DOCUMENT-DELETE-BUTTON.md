---

## 🔧 **Implementation Details**

### **1. Frontend Changes** (`app/templates/upload.html`)

**Action Button (line 492-494):**
```javascript
<button onclick="deleteAIDocument(${doc.id}, '${doc.filename}')" 
        class="text-red-600 hover:text-red-900" 
        title="Delete Document">
    <i class="fas fa-trash"></i>
</button>
```

**JavaScript Function (lines 577-602):**
```javascript
async function deleteAIDocument(documentId, filename) {
    // Confirmation dialog
    if (!confirm(`Are you sure you want to delete "${filename}"?\n\nThis action cannot be undone.`)) {
        return;
    }
    
    // DELETE API call
    const response = await fetch(`/api/ai-documents/${documentId}`, {
        method: 'DELETE',
        headers: {'Content-Type': 'application/json'}
    });
    
    if (response.ok) {
        showNotification('Document deleted successfully', 'success');
        loadDocuments(currentPage); // Reload table
    } else {
        showNotification('Failed to delete document', 'error');
    }
}
```

### **2. Backend API Endpoint** (`app/main.py`)

**DELETE Endpoint (lines 1517-1548):**
```python
@app.delete("/api/ai-documents/{document_id}")
async def delete_ai_document(request: Request, document_id: int):
    """Delete an AI Document Classification (user can delete own, admin can delete any)"""
    
    # Authentication check
    current_user = require_auth(request)
    
    # Get document to check ownership
    document = db.get_ai_document_classification_by_id(document_id)
    
    # Permission check: users can delete own, admin can delete any
    user_role = current_user.get('role', 'viewer')
    if user_role != 'admin' and document['user_id'] != current_user['id']:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=403, detail="No permission")
    
    # Delete document
    success = db.delete_ai_document_classification(document_id)
    
    return {"message": "Document deleted successfully"}
```

### **3. Database Method** (`app/database.py`)

**Delete Method (lines 982-1017):**
```python
def delete_ai_document_classification(self, document_id: int) -> bool:
    """Delete an AI Document Classification and its associated file"""
    
    # Get file path
    cursor.execute("""
        SELECT file_path FROM ai_document_classifications WHERE id = ?
    """, (document_id,))
    
    file_path = row[0] if row else None
    
    # Delete from database
    cursor.execute("""
        DELETE FROM ai_document_classifications WHERE id = ?
    """, (document_id,))
    
    # Delete physical file
    if file_path and os.path.exists(file_path):
        os.remove(file_path)
    
    return success
```
